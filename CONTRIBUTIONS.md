Hey!

You made it to this doc, which probably suggests you have an idea / contribution to make to this repo. Awesome!

Here are some general notes about contributions / pull requests:

- Typo / spelling / grammar corrections are welcome! 
- If I linked your work and haven't cited my work to your tastes, you can make a PR as to how you would like it to be linked / credited.
- Similarly, if I linked to your work / blog post etc, and want it taken down, just let me know.
- If you would like to add a section, consider opening an issue to discuss why you think it's a valueable addition before making a PR. There's a good chance you know more than me on the topic you want to contribute, so you can skip making an issue and go straight to a PR.
- If I have made a technical error / am mis-representing a concept _PLEASE_ let me know. Make an Issue / PR letting me know where I screwed up. I'm happy to know, won't offended (unless  you're a mega jerk about it). I'm trying to learn this junk after all.
- Try and be pleasant. It's the internet, and people are jerks all the time, so let's be awesome to each other yeah?
- Thanks for being here and EVEN just THINKING  contributing. You're excellent.

Much love and all that,

-tees
